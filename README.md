Initially created because I was getting errors with pip install ta-lib (since it tried to compile ta-lib and couldn't find the binaries).
Contains precompiled binaries for Windows x64 TA-lib.  Simply extract the zip file to C:\, and then you should be able to use them to build the python module, or just use them in general.
